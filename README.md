## The Sighting

On the night of November 15th, 2025, around 9:15 PM, I stepped outside in Claremore, Oklahoma to do some casual stargazing. It was a clear night—perfect conditions for observing the sky. As I looked up, something unusual caught my attention.

Moving silently across the sky was a formation of glowing, chrome-like spheres arranged in a triangular pattern. They emitted a soft, bluish-white glow and traveled smoothly from one horizon toward the other. What made it even stranger was that smaller orbs appeared to be orbiting around the central formation, almost like electrons circling a nucleus.

There was no sound. No blinking lights like you'd see on an aircraft. Just this silent, glowing triangle drifting across the stars.

I watched it for maybe 30 seconds before it disappeared from view. I have no explanation for what I saw that night.

After telling friends and family about the experience, I realized how hard it was to describe in words alone. So I decided to build this simulation—a way to show people exactly what I witnessed that night, rather than trying to explain it. Now when the topic comes up, I can just share this link and say, "Here, this is what I saw."
